  <h1> PokéShiro </h1>
  <p><em><strong>Pokémon ROM Hack</strong></em></p>
  <p> PokéShiro began life as a joke ROM Hack, based around the premise of Google Translate, but developed into an actual attempt at recreating the original experience in a new and fresh way. <br>
  It's currently on haitus due to lack of knowledge of original hardware, as I wanted it to run on a proper GB/GBC system. <br>
  While there has been other attempts at doing so, usually using Pokémon Red as a base, such as Red ++, I chose to use Blue as a base, as I prefer it, <br />
  and it matches the color of the optional main character James. <br>
  Now I would consider using Pokémon Blue to be the harder option, due to less availability concerning information, ROM Hacks, or tools, but I prefer it. <br />
  The main draw to this ROM Hack wold be the option to play as Ash, or as James following a slightly different timeline, but sticking to the plot of the Anime, and seeing the game from his perspective.
  The joke ROM Hack became PokéNero (working title) which has yet to start development. </p>

    <h1> Super Mario Bros. Christmas Edition (working title) </h1>
    <p><em><strong>Super Mario Bros. ROM Hack</strong></em></p>
    <p> A Super Mario Bros. ROM Hack that started development recently, and I'm hoping to have it out by Christmas time 2020.
    It's mostly a sprite hack that gives you 5 lives as in the All-Stars version on the Super Nintendo.
    This hack started to get me more familiar with sprite hacking and the NES in general, and also becase I love Christmas time. <br />
    It was inspired by a Christmas Vinesauce Joel stream from 2014, that can be found here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wO9P027aGk">[Vinesauce] Joel - Christmas Santa Mario Games + Smash Brothers for Wii U</a>. </p>

    <h1> Here Today, Gone Tomorrow </h1>
    <p><em><strong>A Game Created in RPG Maker VX Ace</strong></em></p>
    <p> Here Today, Gone Tomorrow was my attempt at creating a game in its entirety. Based off of my enjoyment of police procedral shows and RPGs, I decided to develop a game to play with those expectations.
      I enjoy writing content, so while it is dialog heavy, I did my best to make the characters feel real, but still grounded in the reality of the game. <br /> <br />
      The story follows Xavier O'Donovan, with you making the choices, such as what he says, and how he interacts with those around him, causing the story to dramatically shift, and how they treat you to shift as well.
      Xavier is a police detective, currently off of the force on "forced leave" after a recent shootout, that left an innocent dead or injured. Coming to terms with the fact that he hasn't seen his daughter in years, after her disappearance, he takes this time off to go in search of her.
      While I wouldn't call it a comedy, I would most closely consider it a mixture of a JRPG with point-and-click elements like quips and comments. <br /> <br />

      While scripts were used, it was conceptually my own creation. <br /> <br />

      It stopped development due to a lack of time and money. However, I do intend on continuing development after my other projects are completed, and I have sufficient funding to finish the project.
      It also had a possible planned revival as a 3D game eventally, using the Unreal or Unity game engine.
